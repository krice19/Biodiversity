# Overview

This analysis looks at bacterial samples from various volunteers.  The code creates an interactive dashboard with 3 charts.  I used html, JS, and d3 to read in JSON data and create a drop down menu selecting a specific volunteer ID.  Once this ID is selected from the drop down, demographic info and three charts are changed to display data specific to that ID.  I create a bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart to display different data relative to bacterial analysis.  In addition to chart creation, I added an image and styling to the jumbroton,  paragraph text to explain the dashboard, and a description to each chart.

The dashboard can be viewed at:
